Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo

Problem Motivation:

One member of our group participated in a nearby volunteer organization that had slightly over 10 members. The group required us to devote a certain number of volunteering hours each week, but since everyone had varying schedules, it was challenging to allocate time slots equally among all members. Therefore, we aim to create a web application that can assist organizers in distributing time slots as equitably as feasible.

User Stories

As a user who wants to distribute tasks, I want to be able to do so in an efficient and equal manner, so that everyone gets their fair share of work.
As a user who wants to distribute tasks, I want to be able to make last minute changes to personnel availability and still come up with a reasonably fair distribution of work.
As a user who wants to distribute tasks, I want to be able to view how much effort each member has put in, so that I can better allocate future time slots with the information.
As a user who is assigned tasks, I want to be able to view my allocated time slots in a clear manner.
Target Audience

Our target audience is people from certain organisations that needs task allocation solutions.

Aspects

The important aspect of the task allocation problem is to distribute tasks among personnel as efficiently and equitably as possible.

Types of Users

There are 2 types of users: 1 is the project owner, and the other is the project viewers (members)

Desired Outcome

The desired outcome for the project owner is to distribute tasks as fairly and efficiently as possible. The desired outcome for the project viewers is to view the tasks assigned to them.

Features

Assuming that there is a list of tasks that needs to be done through the week. We want to design a web app that organises and disseminates the tasks to people that need to carry out the tasks based on time frame, deadline, relative importance and availability of people.

A Web app provides an interface where users can provide a list of tasks, people and priorities and get a task list for each person.

After creating the list and running the algorithm, there is an option to mark tasks as complete and, reassign tasks manually and rerun the algorithm with those completed tasks not being redistributed.

- signup and login features (completed)

- inputting of tasks and personnel information (completed)

- suggesting to user (admin) a possible allocation of tasks based on constraints

- allowing user (admin) to fix certain task allocations to certain people

- Option to mark tasks incomplete/complete and re-run task allocation

- Allowing user (members) to view tasks assigned to them
